## ELECTRIC VEHICLES GROWTH ANALYSIS(FROM  2010 ONWARDS)

##  The Dataset
This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). On this Dataframe I am  going to analysis the evolution of the electric car industry from 2010 onwards focusing on the informations about 'Model', 'Make', 'Electric range', 'Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility' and 'Electric Vehicle Type'.

## About My Work
My analysis provides valuable insights into the current state and trends of electric vehicle (EV) adoption. Here are several ways this analysis can help:

**Market Insights:** Understanding the exponential growth in EV adoption can help manufacturers, investors, and policymakers gauge market trends and future demand.

**Competitive Landscape:** Tesla's dominance highlighted by the bar chart can inform competitors about market positioning and the factors contributing to Tesla's success, such as technology and brand loyalty. This knowledge can guide strategic decisions for other manufacturers.

**Model Performance:** The grid view of total vehicles by model helps identify which EV models are most popular, aiding manufacturers in product development and marketing strategies. They can focus on features that drive sales based on successful models like the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y.

**Incentive Programs:** The pie chart on CAFV eligibility can guide consumers and policymakers in understanding the impact of incentives on EV adoption. This can inform decisions on funding and promoting eligible vehicles.

**Geographic Trends:** The map chart showing geographical distribution allows stakeholders to identify regions with high EV adoption, like Washington. This can lead to targeted marketing efforts, infrastructure investment, and policy advocacy in areas with lower adoption rates.

**Policy Development:** Policymakers can use this data to craft regulations, incentives, and infrastructure plans that encourage EV adoption, particularly in states lagging behind.

**Consumer Awareness:** Understanding eligibility for incentives can help consumers make informed decisions when purchasing an EV, enhancing overall market engagement.

By leveraging these insights, stakeholders can make informed decisions that promote further growth in the EV market and address challenges related to adoption and infrastructure.
## Future Work
I would like to analyze demographic data to understand the characteristics of EV buyers. Identifying trends in age, income, and location can help manufacturers target their marketing efforts effectively.
## Thanks for viewing my work.
